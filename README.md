## 🏛️ The Experience
TimeDial shatters the "textbook barrier" by letting users talk directly to historical figures using a unified, native Google AI stack. By eliminating third-party voice dependencies, we achieve deeper multimodal cohesion and a more stable historical frequency.

## ⚙️ Architecture
TimeDial uses the **Gemini 3.0 Pro** engine for high-fidelity reasoning and **Gemini 2.5 Flash** models for low-latency sensory output (Voice & Image):

1.  **Cognitive Engine:** Gemini 3.0 Pro (with 16K Thinking Budget) for historical accuracy.
2.  **Native TTS:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview TTS for human-like emotional intonation without external keys.
3.  **Visual Reconstruction:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Image for generating period-accurate oil portraits.
4.  **Search Grounding:** Live factual verification via Google Search integration.

## 🚀 Usage
1.  Obtain a **Google Gemini API Key** from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).
2.  Launch the app and enter your key in the secure TimeDial selection dialog.
3.  Choose a historical figure and begin the conversation.
